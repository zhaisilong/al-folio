  abstract = {The combination of library-based screening and artificial intelligence (AI) has been accelerating the discovery and optimization of hit ligands. However, the potential of AI to assist in de novo macrocyclic peptide ligand discovery has yet to be fully explored. In thisstudy, an integrated AI framework called PepScaf was developed to extract the critical scaffold relative to bioactivity based on a vast dataset from an initial invitro selection campaign against a model protein target, interleukin-17C (IL-17C). Taking the generated scaffold, a focused macrocyclic peptide library was rationally constructed totarget IL-17C, yielding over 20 potent peptides that effectively inhibited IL-17C/IL-17RE interaction. Notably, the top two peptides displayed exceptional potency with IC50 values of 1.4 nM. This approach presents aviable methodology formore efficient macrocyclic peptide discovery, offering potential time and cost savings. Additionally, this is also the first report regarding the discovery of macrocyclic peptides against IL17C/IL-17RE interaction.},
